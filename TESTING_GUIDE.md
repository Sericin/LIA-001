## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Scenarios

### **Phase 1: Basic Agent Flow Testing**

#### Test 1: Simple Conversation Flow
**Input**: "Hello, can you help me understand your capabilities?"
**Expected**: Main agent responds, no routing to specialized agents
**Validation**: Check response completeness and clarity

#### Test 2: Research Agent Routing  
**Input**: "I need detailed information about commercial real estate market trends"
**Expected**: Routes to research_agent ‚Üí uses search tools ‚Üí provides comprehensive info
**Validation**: Verify research quality and source citations

#### Test 3: Tool Usage Testing
**Input**: "Search for the latest news about AI in real estate"
**Expected**: Uses Tavily search tool ‚Üí processes results ‚Üí provides summary
**Validation**: Check tool call success and result integration

### **Phase 2: Lease Analysis Testing**

#### Test 4: Basic Lease Analysis
**Input**: "Please analyze this commercial lease document: [paste simple lease text]"
**Expected**: Routes to kb_lease_doc_agent ‚Üí processes with v22-prompt1-establish-baseline-terms
**Validation**: Check for baseline terms identification

#### Test 5: Complex Lease with Review
**Input**: Complex lease with ambiguous terms and onerous provisions
**Expected**: 
1. kb_lease_doc_agent completes primary analysis
2. Automatically routes to reviewer_agent
3. Reviewer performs multi-phase analysis
4. Returns comprehensive findings with flags/clusters/confidence metrics

**Sample Complex Lease Input**:
```
COMMERCIAL LEASE AGREEMENT

Property: 123 Business Plaza, Suite 500
Tenant: ABC Corp
Landlord: XYZ Properties

TERM: Five (5) years commencing on a date to be determined by Landlord

RENT: Base rent of $25 per square foot annually, subject to annual increases at Landlord's discretion up to 15%, plus additional charges as deemed necessary by Landlord

MAINTENANCE: Tenant responsible for all repairs, maintenance, and improvements to the premises, building systems, parking areas, and surrounding grounds, regardless of cause or necessity

DEFAULT: Any delay in rent payment beyond 24 hours constitutes default, entitling Landlord to immediate termination and damages equal to remaining lease term payments

ASSIGNMENT: Tenant may not assign or sublet without Landlord's consent, which may be withheld for any reason or no reason

INSURANCE: Tenant must maintain comprehensive insurance acceptable to Landlord, with limits as determined by Landlord from time to time
```

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Legal uncertainties flagged (vague dates, discretionary increases)
- [ ] Ambiguities identified (undefined terms, discretionary clauses) 
- [ ] Onerous provisions clustered (maintenance burden + default terms)
- [ ] Confidence calibration reflects uncertainty levels
- [ ] Recommendations include legal counsel suggestion

### **Phase 3: Configuration Testing**

#### Test 6: Review Depth Levels
Test different configuration settings:

**Basic Level**:
```json
{"review_depth_level": "basic", "enable_legal_uncertainty_detection": false}
```

**Comprehensive Level**:
```json
{
  "review_depth_level": "comprehensive",
  "enable_legal_uncertainty_detection": true,
  "enable_ambiguity_detection": true, 
  "enable_onerous_clustering": true,
  "enable_confidence_calibration": true
}
```

#### Test 7: Confidence Calibration Strategies
Test each strategy with the same input:
- `"confidence_calibration_strategy": "conservative"`  
- `"confidence_calibration_strategy": "balanced"`
- `"confidence_calibration_strategy": "aggressive"`

**Validation**: Different confidence scores and uncertainty ranges

#### Test 8: Flag Sensitivity Testing
```json
{
  "flag_sensitivity_legal": "high",
  "flag_sensitivity_ambiguity": "high", 
  "max_flags_per_analysis": 30
}
```
**Expected**: More flags detected with higher sensitivity

## üîß Debugging Tips

### **Common Issues and Solutions**
1. **Agent Not Routing**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - The routing now checks both AI responses AND conversation history for keywords
   - Keywords for lease analysis: "lease", "rental", "valuation", "commercial real estate", "tenant", "landlord", "rent"
   - Keywords for research: "research", "information", "details", "market trends", "search for"
2. **Limited Flag Detection**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Enhanced legal uncertainty patterns now detect:
   - Sole/absolute discretion language
   - "For any reason or no reason" clauses  
   - "Regardless of" risk shifting
   - Immediate action without notice/cure
   - Rights waivers and tenant expense burdens
   - Penalty provisions and environmental liability
3. **Missing Analysis Results**: Verify API keys and prompt pulling
4. **Low Confidence Scores**: Adjust calibration strategy or thresholds  
5. **Performance Issues**: Check LangSmith traces for bottlenecks
6. **Tool Failures**: Verify Tavily API key and connectivity

### **Routing Troubleshooting**
If agents aren't routing properly:
- Check that your input contains relevant keywords (see list above)
- Verify the conversation context is being captured
- Use `test_routing_fix.py` to test routing logic offline

### **LangGraph Studio Debugging**
- Use the graph visualization to understand flow
- Check individual node outputs in the state panel
- Monitor token usage in the metrics panel
- Use interrupts to pause execution at critical points
